            My website dynamically generates webpages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end to display
            running results fetched from the database. On the backend, the server runs Node.js 20 with Express and
            MySQL2 to handle requests and serve the webpage, while results are scraped primarily from Athletic.net,
             for now, using Python and stored in a MySQL database. The web app and database are both hosted on 
            Microsoft Azure with Cloudflare DNS and are deployed with GitHub, ensuring seamless performance and 
            scalability.

            In the year selector, 0_example is a table with example information to show how the Quick Links table 
            is dynamically generated using the information in the database table.
